Installing and Upgrading WendzelNNTPd under Linux/BSD/*nix:
===========================================================

Note: There is a additional documentation file called
       documentation.pdf included.

To compile the server + console admin tool under *nix/Linux/BSD:
  $ ./configure   <-- checks only for needed tools+libs of the server
  $ make

To compile the GUI too you need libQt4-dev installed:
  $ cd gui/src
  $ ./compile     <-- needs libQt4, qmake and g++

Now you should either install a new WendzelNNTPd or upgrade an existing
one.

>>> Installation:

To install everything (also the GUI, if it was compiled) run install.sh
as user root:
  $ su
  # make install

>>> Upgrade:

For an upgrade two additional tasks need to be done:

1. If you do not use the default config file, you also should make a
copy of your wendzelnntpd.conf before running 'make install' and then
copy it back.

2. Since 'make install' creates a backup of your usenet database file,
you simply have to copy the backup file (named usenet.db.Timestamp.bkp)
back to 'usenet.db' using 'cp'.

Here is an upgrade example. Run as user 'root':
# cp /usr/local/etc/{wendzelnntpd.conf,wendzelnntpd.conf.backup}
# make install
# cp /var/spool/news/wendzelnntpd/usenet.db.INSERT_DATE_HERE.bkp \
  /var/spool/news/wendzelnntpd/usenet.db

Installing WendzelNNTPd under Windows:
======================================

Either you simply install it using the Setup.exe you can download from
one of the sourceforge mirrors (-> sf.net/projects/wendzelnntpd) or you
have to compile everything from the source code.

NOTE: It is RECOMMENDED to use the pre compiled installer! It isn't
      easy to build the software from its code under win32!

To build the software from code nevertheless: here is -- in short --
what you need to do:

I use this software to do the job:

	- Dev-C++, includes lots of needed programs:
	   \- gcc
	   \- g++
	   \- make
	   \- ...
	- sqlite libs
	- regex libs (rx)
	- qt win32, includes the needed qmake
	- gnu win32 flex
	- gnu win32 bison
	- pthread lib

Okay, let's say that you have installed everything and that all the
needed binaries are in your %path% (don't forget the Qt4 binaries!).

First, load the project in Dev-C++, then _before doing anything else_
tell this shit damn buggy tool that you want to use a CUSTOM Makefile
(Project -> Options -> Makefile). Use the 'Makefile.win32' as the de-
fault Makefile. Then compile the code, what compiles the server and
the admin tool.

If you also want to have the gui, change into gui\src and run the
script 'compile.bat', what creates the GUI tool in the releases\
subdirectory.

To install the compiled programms under windows, you have to copy
all the following files in one and the same directory:

bin\wendzelnntpadm.exe
bin\wendzelnntpd.exe
gui\src\release\wendzelnntpGUI.exe
log.txt
start_daemon.bat
LICENSE.txt
README_win32.txt
wendzelnntpd.conf
usenet.db

You also need these files you can find in the subdirectories of
your Dev-C++ installation and the subdirectories of your pthreads
and your Qt4 installation:

pthreadGC2.dll, rx.dll, mingwm10.dll, qtcore4.dll, qtgui4.dll

Good luck!

Have fun and please report all bugs (even typos) you can find!
